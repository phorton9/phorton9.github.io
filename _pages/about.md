Professionally
======
My career has been a manifestation of the multi-armed bandit problem. I began without much knowledge of the rewards for various careers and set out to explore. I started in engineering, spent time in product design then forayed into business with an MBA. It was in this (first) return to school that I found an interest in statistics and learned the value of combining information systems and analytics. I took this to a short-lived start-up (RIP Arivale) that was focused on using data to improve health outcomes for customers. At Arivale, I learned about the work the research team was doing with modeling and machine learning that could have profound positive impacts on the lives of our customers. All good things are not meant to be and the company shut down but this experience set me on the pursuit of a new goal.

After that, I took a job as a data analyst but I wasn't feeling fulfilled. With the support of my wife, we decided to move to Atlanta where I would go back to school for the MS in Analytics program at Georgia Tech. The one year program flew by and I felt as engaged and fulfilled as I had in my whole career. After finishing, I took a job in sales forecasting while continuing to work as a TA for one of my professors but I still wanted to understand the concepts fundamental to machine learning at a deeper level. Then, my advisor encouraged me to apply to the PhD program at Georgia Tech. Now that I have started, I wish I could have found this path earlier.

Personally
======
I was born and raised in Birmingham, AL as the youngest of three boys. I stayed in the state and went to undergrad at Auburn University. After graduating, I moved to South Carolina and spent ~7 years there. Next, I moved to Seattle, WA for two years before moving back to the Southeast. I got married during the pandemic and my wife and I had our first child, Eleanor, in August 2021. My wife is pregnant again and due in May of 2023. We bought a house in the Southwest part of Atlanta in a neighborhood called Venetian Hills. We have a dog and cat so we have a full house. 

Fun-Fact - J'ai lu la serie de Harry Potter en Francais. Je ai appris le Francais quand je travaillais chez Michelin and je continue de le pratiquer. 

Hobbies
------
Most recently, I have been experimenting with electronics and micro-controllers. Some of the projects include: voice activated lamp, custom reading light, and freezer alarm. 

Other hobbies include tennis, hiking, working out, and cooking.
