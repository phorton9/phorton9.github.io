Sequential analysis is not a new topic but it has experienced a renaissance with increasingly fast feedback for app developers. The roots of sequential analysis come from Quality Control in manufacturing but tech companies are beginning to find these methods valuable. No longer do they have to plan for fixed length campaigns but rather can utilize dynamic sample sizes. Results for A/B testing can be available nearly instantly which facilitates shorter decision times and improved product performance. In this post, I will explain the advantages of using sequential analysis for hypothesis testing.

If you need a refresher on hypothesis testing, I suggest you review this video. Otherwise, I will assume you have a foundational knowledge of hypothesis testing.

Consider the scenario where an app developer wants to experiment with a new feature to increase in-app purchases. Assume they can track the frequency of visits and amount purchased to calculate a metric Average Purchases per Visit (APV).
