Decision making is built around uncertainty. You may be willing to undergo a surgical procedure if the doctor is confident in the diagnosis. If the doctor expresses more uncertainty, you may find the risk is not work taking and opt for other treatments. However, typically you will see output of predictive models as only a scalar value for regression or single class for a categorical problem. You might see the classification of an image as either "Cat" or "Dog". Conformal inference has emerged as a method for quantifying uncertainty by giving a set or interval as a model output. In this post, I will describe why this is a promising application for statistical decision theory.
